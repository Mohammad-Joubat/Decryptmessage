# Decryptmessage
Create a decoding algorithm. 

In my project i will create a decoding algorithm. 
Imagine thatwe received a secret text file. 
The text in the text file is encrypted. 
Every letter in the text replaced by a different letter in the English alphabet.

Example:
	Original text: AB DMF GR YGI
	Decrypted text: MY CAT IS BIG.  



My text file is(see message file uploaded to this project) :  
'Puackich, hvhnkrally oaths phufhck. All ymr nhhd is Pykemn.'
J.U.U.U Kmltin. 
mmps iks nmk eio; ---> hkmu


* The encryption for the above text is : 

Practice  eventually makes perfect  All you need is Python
